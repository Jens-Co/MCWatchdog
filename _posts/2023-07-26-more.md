- Notification
<br>
    When server goes down we will automatically warn a configurated role that the server is offline.
<br>
<br>
- Remote Connect
<br>
    Remote Connect allows you to send commands to console and rereive feedback within a discord channel. For your own safety we do not store any passwords and a login cache is at place which will remove itself after 30 Minutes also use this at your own risk ( Use only in private text channel ).
